# Atlas-Experimental-Atlas-macOS/Linux

This repository contains the macOS and experimental builds of the Atlas CLI. It isn’t the main Atlas repo—this one is specifically for macOS users and for testing features that aren’t ready for the stable Windows/Linux release.

**What this repo includes**

- Atlas CLI for macOS and Linux users
- Experimental features and early previews
- Releases that are always one version ahead of the main project
- Test builds that may change often

**Why this repo exists**

- This is a place to try out new ideas, test upcoming features, and provide macOS users with earlier access to updates. Things here may be unstable or incomplete, but they show what’s coming next for Atlas.

**Who should use this?**

- macOS or Linux users who want the newest features right away
- Anyone curious about what’s coming in the next Atlas version

**Minimum Requirements**

- MacOS High Sierra (10.13) or newer
- Any Linux Distro that supports Python 3.8 or newer)
- Python 3.8

**Using Windows?**

This can work on Windows, But I recommend using the official Windows build coded in C#.

**A quick note**

Because these builds are ahead of the main release, expect some rough edges and occasional breaking changes.

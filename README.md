# Atlas-Experimental-Atlas-macOS

This repository contains the macOS and experimental builds of the Atlas CLI. It isn’t the main Atlas repo—this one is specifically for macOS users and for testing features that aren’t ready for the stable Windows/Linux release.

**What this repo includes**

- macOS builds for both Apple Silicon and Intel
- Experimental features and early previews
- Releases that are always one version ahead of the main project
- Test builds that may change often

**Why this repo exists**

- This is a place to try out new ideas, test upcoming features, and provide macOS users with earlier access to updates. Things here may be unstable or incomplete, but they show what’s coming next for Atlas.

**Who should use this?**

- macOS users who want the newest features right away
- Anyone curious about what’s coming in the next Atlas version

**A quick note**

Because these builds are ahead of the main release, expect some rough edges and occasional breaking changes.
